Hello, I'm Hanrong Zhang. Currently, I am a master's student in journalism at the School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University. My advisor is Associate Professor Chengjun Wang, and I am also a member of the Computational Communication Collaboratory at Nanjing University. My research interests lie in the field of computational social science. While I acknowledge that I still have much to learn in the realm of academic research, I am determined to put in my best efforts.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Nankai University, where I had the pleasure of getting to know almost every cat on campus. In my free time, I enjoy photography, playing the piano, stargazing. Welcome to my personal website to know more about me!
